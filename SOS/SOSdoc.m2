        A type to store SOS decompositions of polynomials
    Description
      Text
        A polynomial $f\in K[x]$ is a sum-of-squares (SOS) if it can be written as
        $$f = \sum_i d_i g_i^2,$$
        where the $g_i$ are polynomials in $K[x]$ and the $d_i$ are weights in $K$.
        This data type stores SOS polynomials in terms of the summands.  
        The type is a hash table consisting of the polynomials to be 
        squared and summed (the 'generators'), corresponding coefficients,
        and the base ring.  The most common way an SOSPoly comes to life is
	as the result of an SOS decomposition.  See @TO SDPResult@ for more on this.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = 2*x^4+5*y^4-2*x^2*y^2+2*x^3*y;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        sosPoly sol
      Text
        Of course one can also construct SOSPolys by specifying all their ingredients.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        s = sosPoly(R, {x+1,y}, {2,3} )
        peek s
      Text
        The ingredients of a SOS can be recovered using the expected commands:
      Example
        gens s
        ring s
        coefficients s
      Text
        The length of an SOS is the number of summands:
      Example
        length s
      Text
        Sums of squares support many common operations with polynomials:
      Example
        2 * s
        s + s
        s * s
        s == s
      Text
        The actual polynomial can be recovered using @TO sumSOS@:
      Example
        sumSOS s
      Text
        @TO SOSPoly@ supports the @TO substitute@ command.  This
        cannot be used to change the coefficient field, though.  See @TO "Coefficients"@ for some
	of the limitations.
      Example
        S = QQ[x,y,z];
        sub (s, S)

        This method solves SOS problems.
        Given a rational polynomial $f(x)$, it attempts to find a rational positive semidefinite matrix $Q$ and a vector of monomials $mon$ such that
        $$f(x) = mon' Q mon.$$ 
        The algorithm first computes a floating point solution, 
        and then tries to obtain an exact solution by rounding the numerical result. 
        If the rounding fails, the numerical solution is returned.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = 2*x^4+5*y^4-2*x^2*y^2+2*x^3*y;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        Q = sol#GramMatrix
        mon = sol#Monomials
        transpose(mon)*Q*mon - f
      Text
        {\bf SOS with parameters:}
        If the coefficients of the polynomial are linearly parametrized, we can search for parameters which render a polynomial to be a SOS.
        In the following example, the variable $t$ will be treated as a free parameter.
      Example
        R = QQ[x][t];
        f = (t-1)*x^4+1/2*t*x+1;
        sol = solveSOS (f);
        sosPoly(sol)
        sol#Parameters
      Text 
        {\bf SOS with parameter optimization:}
        The method also allows to optimize a linear function of the parameters.
        More precisely, given a polynomial $f(x;p)$ that depends affinely on some parameters $p$, we can solve the problem

        $$min_{p} \, objFun(p) \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, f(x; p) \, is SOS $$

        In the following example we minimize $-t$ in order to find a lower bound for the polynomial $x^2-3x$:
      Example
        R = QQ[x][t];
        f = x^2 - 3*x - t;
        sol = solveSOS (f, -t, RoundTol=>12);
        sol#Parameters
      Text
        By default the method tries to obtain rational values of the parameters.
        Since there is a trade-off between rounding and optimality, we specify the @TO2 {RoundTol,"rounding precision"}@ as an optional input argument.

    Description

        This method solves a primal/dual pair of semidefinite programs.
        Given symmetric matrices $C, A_i$ and a vector $b$, the primal problem is

        $$min_{X} \, C \bullet X \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, A_i \bullet X = b_i \, and \, X \geq 0$$

        and the dual problem is

        $$max_{y,Q} \, \sum_i b_i y_i \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, Q = C - \sum_i y_i A_i \, and \, Q \geq 0$$

        The default algorithm is a dual interior point method implemented in M2. 
        A strictly feasible initial point $y_0$ may be provided by the user. 
        Alternatively, there is an interface to the @TO2 {[solveSDP,Solver],"solvers"}@ CSDP and SDPA.
      Example
        C = matrix {{1,0},{0,2}};
        A = matrix {{0,1},{1,0}};
        b = matrix {{-1}};

    Description
      Text
        Given a non-negative ternary form $f$, this method uses Hilbert's algorithm to compute a decomposition of 
	$f$ as sum-of-squares of rational functions: $f=\frac{\prod_ip_i}{\prod_iq_i}$. 
        The method returns null if $f$ is not non-negative.  
	As an example, consider the homogeneous Motzkin polynomial:
      Example
         R = RR[x,y,z];
    	 f = nonnegativeForm ("Motzkin", {x,y,z});
    	 (p,q) = sosdecTernary (f, Solver=>"CSDP");
      Text
        The result, in this case, is just a quotient of two sums of squares.
      Example
         (#p, #q)
         f * sumSOS q#0 == sumSOS p#0

        The method then tries to find an SOS polynomial in the generated ideal.
        More precisely, given equations $h_1(x),...,h_m(x)$, the method looks for polynomial multipliers $h_i(x)$ such that $\sum_i l_i(x) h_i(x)$ is SOS.
     Example

        More precisely, this method solves the following relaxation

        $$max_{t} \, t \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, f(x) - t \, is SOS $$

        Lower bounds for rational functions can be obtained in a similar way.
        In some cases the minimizer can be extracted with the method @TO recoverSolution@.
      Example
        R=QQ[x];
        f = (x-1)^2 + (x+3)^2;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound(f);

        By default the method tries to obtain a rational lower bound.

      Text
        {\bf Quotient rings:}
        Given an ideal $I$, we can also find a lower bound for $f$ on the variety of $I$.
        This can be done by constructing the associated quotient ring.
        A degree bound must be provided.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y]/ideal(x^2 - x, y^2 - y);
        f = x - y;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound(f,2);
        bound
        f - bound == sosPoly sol
      Text
        {\bf Avoiding quotient rings:}
        Constructing the quotient ring is sometimes too expensive since it requires GrÃ¶bner bases.
        There is an alternative (though weaker) relaxation that avoids GrÃ¶bner bases computation.
        Given equations $h_1(x),...h_m(x)$, we can look for multipliers $l_i(x)$ such that $f(x) - t + \sum_i l_i(x) h_i(x)$ is SOS.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = x - y;
        h = matrix{{x^2 - x, y^2 - y}};
        (bound,sol,mult) = lowerBound (f, h, 2);

        This method creates the kernel and image model of the Gram matrices of a polynomial $f$.

        A Gram matrix representation of $f$ is a symmetric matrix $Q$ such that

        The set of all Gram matrices $Q$ is an affine subspace.

      Text
        The optional argument {\tt RoundTol} specifies the minimal rounding precision in $d$ binary digits.
        
        SOS problems are solved numerically using an SDP solver, and afterwards the package attempts to round the floating point solution to rational numbers.
        The rounding strategy is guaranteed to work whenever the space of Gram matrices is full dimensional.
        For SOS optimization problems the rounding may cause a loss in optimality.
        The argument {\tt RoundTol} allows to control the trade-off between optimality and simplicity.
        Higher values of {\tt RoundTol} lead to better solutions.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,z];
        f = x^4+x^2+z^6-3*x^2*z^2;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound (f,RoundTol=>4);
