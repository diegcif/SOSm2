Dear Professor Christine Berkesch,

Please find below a point by point explanation of our latest changes.

Sincerely,

Diego Cifuentes, Thomas Kahle, Pablo Parrilo

Referee: The package "SumsOfSquares" depends on an updated version of the package
"SemidefiniteProgramming", which is provided.  The user, in order to install
both packages successfully, needs to type these commands:

    installPackage "SemidefiniteProgramming"
    installPackage ("SumsOfSquares", UserMode => true)

Is this mentioned anywhere?  (After the two packages become part of M2 and a
new release is issued, the user will not have to worry about this.)  If it's
not mentioned anywhere, perhaps add a README or INSTALL file at top level in
the zip file that provides the source code of the packages, so it can be stated
in there.

Authors: An INSTALL file is included now.  According to our experiments
UserMode=>true is not necessary, or is it?

Referee: I noticed this missing documentation:

  The fields can be extracted with the operator # (missing documentation).

in the documenation for SDPResult.  Unfortunately, no warning message is
displayed by "installPackage" when the documentation is generated.

Authors: This is fixed by importing the Macaulay2Doc package.  This is
necessary to link to the documentation of the # operator.

Referee: Why not make 0 the default value for verbosity?
Perhaps you think that the verbose information displayed to the user is
important to the user.  But in that case, think of the author of a future
package that calls "solveSOS" -- how is his code to obtain the information,
which you display only to the human reader?

Authors: The referee was guessing correctly. The reason why we the default 
was 1 is that the "Status" value is very important for the user. 
We changed the verbosity default to 0, and the "Status" is now part of the SDPResult.
We also removed the boxes from the displayed output. We believe it now looks much cleaner.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Referee: The last line of this loop has no effect, so could be deleted.

    for s to k-1 do(
        l := splitline(Lpsd#s);
        i := value l#2;
        j := value l#3;
        Xij := value l#4;
        Zij := value l#5;
        Xh#(2*s) = (i,j)=>Xij;
        Xh#(2*s+1) = (j,i)=>Xij;
        Zh#(2*s) = (i,j)=>Zij;
        Zh#(2*s+1) = (j,i)=>Zij;
===>    (i,j,Xij,Zij)
        );

Authors: The line was deleted. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Referee: What's the point of this function?

    getFileName = (ext) -> (
	filename := temporaryFileName() | ext;
	while fileExists(filename) do filename = temporaryFileName();
	filename)

The function temporaryFileName returns a new name every time, so it will not
collide with an existing file.  It can be used directly.

Authors: The function was removed.
