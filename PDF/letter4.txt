Dear Professor Christine Berkesch,

Please find below a point by point explanation of our latest changes.

Sincerely,

Diego Cifuentes, Thomas Kahle, Pablo Parrilo

Referee:

The package "SumsOfSquares" depends on an updated version of the package
"SemidefiniteProgramming", which is provided.  The user, in order to install
both packages successfully, needs to type these commands:

    installPackage "SemidefiniteProgramming"
    installPackage ("SumsOfSquares", UserMode => true)

Is this mentioned anywhere?  (After the two packages become part of M2 and a
new release is issued, the user will not have to worry about this.)  If it's
not mentioned anywhere, perhaps add a README or INSTALL file at top level in
the zip file that provides the source code of the packages, so it can be stated
in there.

Authors: 
Diego: I don't understand this. Isn't installPackage "SumsOfSquares" enough?
What is the UserMode option? I have never needed it.

Referee:

I noticed this missing documentation:

  The fields can be extracted with the operator # (missing documentation).

in the documenation for SDPResult.  Unfortunately, no warning message is
displayed by "installPackage" when the documentation is generated.

Authors: This is fixed by importing the Macaulay2Doc package.  This is
necessary to link to the documentation of the # operator.

Referee:

Thank you for decreasing the verbosity, but why not make 0 the default value
for verbosity?  I think this:

    i13 : sol = solveSOS(f,Verbosity=>0)

	  +--------------+-----------------------+
    o13 = | MomentMatrix | 3x3 matrix over RR_53 |
	  +--------------+-----------------------+
	  |  GramMatrix  |   3x3 matrix over QQ  |
	  +--------------+-----------------------+
	  |   Monomials  |   3x1 matrix over R   |
	  +--------------+-----------------------+

    o13 : SDPResult

looks a lot better than this:

    i14 : sol = solveSOS(f)
    Executing CSDP
    Input file: /var/folders/46/9b86vqxj4hjcngvy7kd7sb140000gn/T/M2-25010-0/56.dat-s
    Output file: /var/folders/46/9b86vqxj4hjcngvy7kd7sb140000gn/T/M2-25010-0/57
    Status: SDP solved, primal-dual feasible
    Start rational rounding

	  +--------------+-----------------------+
    o14 = | MomentMatrix | 3x3 matrix over RR_53 |
	  +--------------+-----------------------+
	  |  GramMatrix  |   3x3 matrix over QQ  |
	  +--------------+-----------------------+
	  |   Monomials  |   3x1 matrix over R   |
	  +--------------+-----------------------+

    o14 : SDPResult

Perhaps you think that the verbose information displayed to the user is
important to the user.  But in that case, think of the author of a future
package that calls "solveSOS" -- how is his code to obtain the information,
which you display only to the human reader?

Authors: TK: I'm OK with default verbosity zero.
Diego: Sure we can make zero the default. But I think that the information is important, particularly the "Status". We should either return it as a part of the SDPResult, or create a global variable.

Referee:
The last line of this loop has no effect, so could be deleted.

    for s to k-1 do(
        l := splitline(Lpsd#s);
        i := value l#2;
        j := value l#3;
        Xij := value l#4;
        Zij := value l#5;
        Xh#(2*s) = (i,j)=>Xij;
        Xh#(2*s+1) = (j,i)=>Xij;
        Zh#(2*s) = (i,j)=>Zij;
        Zh#(2*s+1) = (j,i)=>Zij;
===>    (i,j,Xij,Zij)
        );

Authors: The line was deleted. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Referee:
What's the point of this function?

    getFileName = (ext) -> (
	filename := temporaryFileName() | ext;
	while fileExists(filename) do filename = temporaryFileName();
	filename)

The function temporaryFileName returns a new name every time, so it will not
collide with an existing file.  It can be used directly.

Authors: The function was removed.
