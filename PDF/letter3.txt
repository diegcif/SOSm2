Dear Professor Christine Berkesch,

Thanks again for looking at our package. Please find below a point by point explanation of our latest changes.

Sincerely,

Diego Cifuentes, Thomas Kahle, Pablo Parrilo

*****************

1) Referee: Perhaps it is time to update the version number and date

Authors: Done.

2) Referee: Please install 1.14 and make sure the package works.

Authors: We installed M2-1.14 as suggested. A test failed in Ubuntu 18.04 due to a bug in CSDP.  The test was changed so that it passes.  All tests and checkSolver now pass on Ubuntu 18.04 and MacOS with M2-1.14.

3) Referee: I mention the possibility of using formal expressions to display the answer and to check it.

Authors: The referee suggests displaying a sum of squares object as a formal expression, as shown below. It looks nice for the example below, but I am not sure it it would look well for big polynomials.

	i6 :  new Sum from apply (p#coefficients,p#generators,(c,g) -> hold c * (hold g)^2)

                83 2    2 2    43  20 2       2    231773   2 2
	o6 = (5)(- ---x  + y )  + (--)(--x  + x*y)  + (------)(x )
               200             20  43              344000

4) Referee: It would be a good idea to totally suppress this display, unless the user
requests it or an error occurs:

Authors: The printed information is controlled with the option Verbosity, which has three levels. Level 0 prints nothing. Level 1 prints very minimal information, such as the SDP solver status. Level 2 shows the description from above. The default is level 1, so the above information should not be displayed.

5) Referee: Switch to the new name
		"The ", TT "SOS", " package interfaces tries to hide

Authors: Done.

6) Make the members of this list link to the corresponding documentation nodes
          optional, one of "solveSDP", "solveSOS", "sosdecTernary", "sosInIdeal", or "lowerBound"

Authors: Done.

Referee: solveSDP doesn't seem to exist!

Authors: The method "solveSDP" was renamed "optimize" a few months ago. We fixed the name.

7) Fix "an" in "an semidefinite"

Authors: Done.

*  PDF Article  *
*****************

8) Replace
        "The package SumsOfSquares implements sums-of-squares decompositions in Macaulay2"
    with
        "The Macaulay2 package SumsOfSquares decomposes polynomials as sums of squares"

Authors: Done.

9) Referee: Bibliography should include an item for Macaulay2 and for the SemidefiniteProgramming package

Authors: Done. 

10) Referee: Put "Macaulay2" in italic uniformly.

Authors: Done.

11) Referee: Fix "an" in "an sum of squares"

Authors: Done.

12) Referee: Replace
        "Classically, Hilbert characterized in which cases sums of squares coincide
         with nonnegative polynomials as univariate polynomials, quadratic
         polynomials and bivariate quartics"
    with
        "Hilbert showed that the nonnegative polynomials of degree d in n variables
		 are sums of squares if and only if: n=1; or d=2; or n=2 and d=4."

Authors: Done.

13) Referee: Replace "deciding whether" with "deciding if"

Authors: Done.

14) Referee: Replace "a vector with all the" with "a vector whose entries are the"

Authors: Done.

15) Give a reference for the result that a polynomial is SOS if and only if there is semidefinite matrix Q such that ...

Authors: We now reference the book by Blekherman, Parrilo, and Thomas.

16) Referee: Replace
		"called an external semidefinite programming solver (or software) in the background"
	with
		"called an external program to serve as semidefinite programming solver"

Authors: Done.

17) Referee: It seems that the package did not call an external program.
	Rather, it used the package SemidefiniteProgramming, and that package called
	the external program.  Would the authors like the editors to regard the article
	as about both packages?  

Authors: Yes, we would like both packages to be considered for publication. Originally there was a single package. But after CSDP was included in Macaulay2, Mike Stillman suggested to have a separate package only for semidefinite programming. We followed his advice, and moved some of the methods to the new SemidefiniteProgramming package. The SumsOfSquares package heavily relies on the SemidefiniteProgramming package, and the differentiation among both of them is quite subtle.

18) Referee: The meaning of "round" could be clarified:
		"Although the result of the semidefinite programming solver is in floating point, 
		Macaulay2 attempts to round it to obtain a rational Gram matrix."

Authors: This paragraph was reformulated.

19) Referee: Replace
		"The last output is an object of type SOSPoly. 
		This type stores the coefficients ..."
	with
		"The last output is an object of type SOSPoly.  
		In an object of this type are stored the coefficients ..."

Authors: Done.

20) Referee: Replace
		"For such a computation, an (even) degree bound 2d must be given by the user...
		In this case we set 2d = 2."
	with 
		"For such a computation, an even degree bound must be given by the user...
		In the following example we use 2d = 2 as the degree bound."

Authors: Done.

Referee: Does it need to be said twice?
			"A degree bound 2d must be given by the user."

Authors: That the degree bound should be even is pointed out whenever it seems relevant.

21) Referee: This confuses me:
		"Smaller values of RoundTol lead to simpler bounds (smaller denominators), 
		at the expense of a loss in optimality."
	Do you mean you might write a rational polynomial as a sum of squares of
    rational polynomials in two different ways?

Authors: 
It is true that a rational polynomial might admit several rational SOS decompositions. But this is not what this remark is explaining. What we meant to say is that for the rounding procedure we are modifying the coefficients of the (numerical) polynomial slightly, so that the new polynomial admits a rational SOS decomposition. The more we modify the coefficients (smaller RoundTol) the easier it is find a "nice" SOS decomposition, with smaller denominators. 
The sentence now reads as:
    "Smaller values of \verb|RoundTol| lead to rational matrices 
    with smaller denominators but farther from the numerical solution."
