Dear Professor Christine Berkesch,

Thanks again for looking at our package. Please find below a point by point explanation of our latest changes.

Sincerely,

Diego Cifuentes, Thomas Kahle, Pablo Parrilo

*****************
*  Source code  *
*****************

1) Referee: Perhaps it is time to update the version number and date

Authors: 

2) Referee: Please install 1.14 and make sure the package works.

Authors: 

3) Referee: I mention the possibility of using formal expressions to display the answer and to check it.

Authors:

4) Referee: It would be a good idea to totally suppress the SDP solver trace.

Authors:

*  Documentation  *
*******************

5) Referee: Switch to the new name
		"The ", TT "SOS", " package interfaces tries to hide

Authors: Done.

6) Make the members of this list link to the corresponding documentation nodes
          optional, one of "solveSDP", "solveSOS", "sosdecTernary", "sosInIdeal", or "lowerBound"<Paste>

Authors: Done.

Referee: solveSDP doesn't seem to exist!

Authors: The method "solveSDP" was renamed "optimize" a few months ago. We fixed the name.

7) Fix "an" in "an semidefinite"

Authors: Done.

*  PDF Article  *
*****************

8) Replace
        "The package SumsOfSquares implements sums-of-squares decompositions in Macaulay2"
    with
        "The Macaulay2 package SumsOfSquares decomposes polynomials as sums of squares"

Authors: Done.

9) Referee: Bibliography should include an item for Macaulay2 and for the SemidefiniteProgramming package

Authors: Done. 

10) Referee: Put "Macaulay2" in italic uniformly.

Authors: Done.

11) Referee: Fix "an" in "an sum of squares"

Authors: Done.

12) Referee: Replace
        "Classically, Hilbert characterized in which cases sums of squares coincide
         with nonnegative polynomials as univariate polynomials, quadratic
         polynomials and bivariate quartics"
    with
        "Hilbert showed that the nonnegative polynomials of degree d in n variables
		 are sums of squares if and only if: n=1; or d=2; or n=2 and d=4."

Authors: Done.

13) Referee: Replace "deciding whether" with "deciding if"

Authors: Done.

14) Referee: Replace "a vector with all the" with "a vector whose entries are the"

Authors: Done.

15) Give a reference for the result that a polynomial is SOS if and only if there is semidefinite matrix Q such that ...

Referee: We now reference the book by Blekherman, Parrilo, and Thomas.

Authors: We now clarify that 2d is an even integer.

16) Referee: Replace
		"called an external semidefinite programming solver (or software) in the background"
	with
		"called an external program to serve as semidefinite programming solver"

Authors: Done.

17) Referee: It seems that the package did not call an external program.
	Rather, it used the package SemidefiniteProgramming, and that package called
	the external program.  Would the authors like the editors to regard the article
	as about both packages?  

Authors: Yes!!!

18) Referee: The meaning of "round" could be clarified:
		"Although the result of the semidefinite programming solver is in floating point, 
		Macaulay2 attempts to round it to obtain a rational Gram matrix."

Authors: This paragraph was reformulated.

19) Referee: Replace
		"The last output is an object of type SOSPoly. 
		This type stores the coefficients ..."
	with
		"The last output is an object of type SOSPoly.  
		In an object of this type are stored the coefficients ..."

Authors: Done.

20) Referee: Replace
		"For such a computation, an (even) degree bound 2d must be given by the user...
		In this case we set 2d = 2."
	with 
		"For such a computation, an even degree bound must be given by the user...
		In the following example we use 2d = 2 as the degree bound."

Authors: Done.

Referee: Does it need to be said twice?
			"A degree bound 2d must be given by the user."

Authors:

21) Referee: This confuses me:
		"Smaller values of RoundTol lead to simpler bounds (smaller denominators), 
		at the expense of a loss in optimality."
	Do you mean you might write a rational polynomial as a sum of squares of
    rational polynomials in two different ways?
