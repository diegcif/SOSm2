Dear Professor Christine Berkesch,

We thank you and the referee for looking at our package. Following the referee's comments, we made several changes in the source code, documentation, and in the article. Below we provide a point by point explanation of the changes.

Please let us know if anything else is needed.

Sincerely,

Diego Cifuentes, Thomas Kahle, Pablo Parrilo

*****************
*  Source code  *
*****************

1) Referee: Articles in JSAG are always about a single package. Resubmit the source code with just SOS in it.

Authors: We understand that this is the policy of the journal. The newly uploaded code only includes the SOS package.

2) Referee: There are differences in the top level files, which reflect various housekeeping tasks performed on the Macaulay2 side.

     --11
    +-- fails every night under Ubuntu 16.04
    +-- TEST /// --lowerBound
     --13
    +-- keeps failing overnight under Ubuntu 16.04, host habanero
    +-- TEST /// --sosdecTernary

Diego: The M2 repository omits two tests (above). Each of them has multiple subtests. For instance, lowerBound has six subtests, as can be seen when running the command: 
    checkSolver ("CSDP",lowerBound)
I would like to know which subtests are failing.

Thomas: I remeber discussing this issue with Referee last fall.  I don't
understand why these tests fail for him.  Ideally they should not
fail?  I think Mike Stillman built it under some sort of Linux and all
tests passed.

3) Referee: What about changing the name of the package to SumsOfSquares?

Authors: We adopted the name suggested by the referee.

4) "Executing CSDP
    Input file: /var/folders/hq/7lqcg89j1pq8m9vq_333xfwh0000gn/T/M2-3434-0/53.dat-s
    Output file: /var/folders/hq/7lqcg89j1pq8m9vq_333xfwh0000gn/T/M2-3434-0/54
    Status: SDP solved, primal-dual feasible
    Start rational rounding"

Referee: The 5 lines of trace output are noise

Diego:
I changed the optional argument Verbose to Verbosity. Nothing is printed when it is set to 0.

Thomas: I think this is not so good.  "Verbose" is a symbol that is
globally defined and used by many packages.  Maybe it is better to
stick to the Boolean Verbose and just omit the above lines if not
Verbose?  Currently the package is also broken because "Verbosity" is
not exported.

5) Referee: Don't use "return" so much

Authors: We removed all appearances of "return" in the last line.

*******************
*  Documentation  *
*******************

6) Referee: Make sure that the hyphens follow the English grammar.

Authors: We checked our usage of the hyphens throughout the documentation. We believe it is correct now.

Thomas: So the convention is now that sum-of-squares is hyphenated?
Diego: "sums-of-squares problems" is correct with hyphens, because there "sums-of-squares" is being used as a single noun adjunct modifying "problems". 

7) "The SemidefiniteProgramming package in Macaulay2 ships with the CSDP solver"

Referee: Reveal the name of the package as a link to it
Referee: Replace "ships with" with "includes"

Authors: Done.

Referee: Spell out "CSDP".

Authors: We clarified that CSDP is a solver (software tool).

8) "Check Solver for how to configure different solvers."

Referee: Change "Check" to "See".
Referee: Remove "different".

Authors: Done.

9) Referee: All sentences should end with punctuation. Don't end with colons.

Authors: Done.

10) "contains in particular the SOS decomposition"

Referee: Remove "in particular".

Authors: Done.

11) Referee: change "found decomposition" to "decomposition found", and check similar constructions

Diego:
I changed it, but I am not sure what he means by "similar constructions"
Do you understand, Thomas?

12) Referee: Spell out acronyms (SOS, SDP).

Authors: We spelled out most of the occurrences.

13) Referee: The word "summands" is unclear.

Authors: We replaced the word "summand" throughout the documentation.

14) "This method tests if various functions work properly using a specified solver. "

Referee: change "if" to "whether"

Authors: Done.

15) Referee: What is a "solver"?

Authors: We now explain in the documentation that it is software tool.

16) "The most basic invocation is using only the name of the solver. "

Referee: Change "is using "to "uses"

Authors: Done.

17) Referee: The output from checkSolver looks bad.

Authors: We fixed this issue by using "netList(---, Boxes=>false)".

18) Referee: The documentation for chooseMons is incomplete.

Authors: We do not want the method chooseMons to be available to the user. Hence, we removed its documentation.

19) "Given an SOSPoly with coefficients in the reals"
    
Referee: You are using the identifier SOSPoly as though it were an English word.  Stick to words.  Check for other similar things.

Authors: We fixed this issue throughout the documentation.

20) Referee: Change documentation node "coefficients field" to "coefficient field".

Authors: Done.

21) "Once the rational world has been left, there is usually now way back."

Referee: Change "now" to "no".

Authors: Done.

Referee: Leaving the rational world is ambiguous. 
Referee: The paragraph goes on to discuss "clean", but that doesn't get you back to the rational world.

Authors: We rewrote the paragraph to clarify both points.

=============================================================================

*****************
*  PDF Article  *
*****************

22) Referee: Peyrl is listed as an author of the package, but this authorship is not
acknowledged in the article.  Perhaps it should be. Or not?

Diego: We discussed about this before, and we agreed to leave him out of the
article. But we need to justify it.

Thomas: Maybe just add a sentence to the PDF somewhere that
acknowledges that we started the package with a proof-of-concept
implementation by Parillo and Peyrl?

23) Referee: Bibliography should include an item for Macaulay2 and for the SemidefiniteProgramming package

Authors: Done. 

24) Referee: Make sure that the hyphens follow the English grammar.

Authors: We corrected this issue.

25) "The SOS package allows to perform computations ..."
    "... and allows to select the SDP solver. "

Referee: Allows whom to perform computations?  Check all other uses of "allow".

Authors: We checked our uses of "allow" in the paper, reformulating most of them.

26) Referee: Change "In the above computation" to "In the computation above"

Authors: Done.

27) "Given a bound 2d ∈ N, "

Referee: The reader will wonder whether d ∈ N is required!

Authors: We now clarify that 2d is an even integer.

28) Referee: What's the definition of "real radical"?

Authors: The real radical of an ideal I is the vanishing ideal of the real zeros of I. This is now explained in the paper.

29) "i1 : R = QQ[x,y,z][s,t]; -- s,t are treated as parameters"

Referee: Move comments about the code to the surrounding prose

Authors: Done.

30) Referee: Don't overuse acronyms such as SOS and SDP.  

Authors: We spelled out most of them.

31) Referee: What is a solver?  

Authors: We explain that it is a software tool.
