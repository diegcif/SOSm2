My guess is that the referee was Dan, and he gave us lots of comments.  Many of the comments are about English grammar, so I am not completely sure that I addressed them correctly.

Below I enumerate all the comments.

********************
*  Macaulay2 code  *
********************

1) Dan: Articles in JSAG are always about a single package.

Diego:
It seems that the SemidefiniteProgramming package won't be certified. I assume that the procedure here should be similar as in NumericalAlgebraicGeometry and its many dependencies. Personally, I do not mind if only the SOS package is certified.

2) Dan: There are differences in the top level files, which reflect various housekeeping tasks performed on the Macaulay2 side.

     --11
    +-- fails every night under Ubuntu 16.04
    +-- TEST /// --lowerBound
     --13
    +-- keeps failing overnight under Ubuntu 16.04, host habanero
    +-- TEST /// --sosdecTernary

Diego:
The M2 repository omits two checks (above). Each of them has multiple subtests (lowerBound has six and sosdecTernary has three). I would like to know which of them are failing, and perhaps only drop those.

3) Dan: What about changing the name of the package to SumsOfSquares?

Diego:
I don't mind. What do you think, Thomas?

4) "Executing CSDP
    Input file: /var/folders/hq/7lqcg89j1pq8m9vq_333xfwh0000gn/T/M2-3434-0/53.dat-s
    Output file: /var/folders/hq/7lqcg89j1pq8m9vq_333xfwh0000gn/T/M2-3434-0/54
    Status: SDP solved, primal-dual feasible
    Start rational rounding"

Dan: The 5 lines of trace output are noise

Diego:
I changed the optional argument Verbose to Verbosity. Nothing is printed when it is set to 0.

5) Dan: Don't use "return" so much

Diego:
I removed most of them.

*******************
*  documentation  *
*******************

6) Dan: Be careful with hyphens (e.g. sum-of-squares)

Diego:
I did my best to fix this.

7) "The SemidefiniteProgramming package in Macaulay2 ships with the CSDP solver"

Dan: Reveal the name of the package as a link to it
    Replace "ships with" with "includes"

Diego: done

Dan: Spell out "CSDP" 

Diego:
I clarified that CSDP is a solver.

8) "Check Solver for how to configure different solvers."

Dan: Change "Check" to "See"
    Remove "different"

Diego: done

9) Dan: All sentences should end with punctuation. Don't end with colons.

Diego: done

10) "contains in particular the SOS decomposition"

Dan: Remove "in particular"

Diego: done

11) Dan: change "found decomposition" to "decomposition found", and check similar constructions

Diego:
I changed it, but I am not sure what he means by "similar constructions"

12) Dan: Spell out acronyms (SOS, SDP).

Diego:
I spelled out most of the occurrences.

13) Dan: The word "summands" is unclear.

Diego:
I fixed it. The word "summand" no longer appears.

14) "This method tests if various functions work properly using a specified solver. "

Dan: change "if" to "whether"

Diego: done

15) Dan: What is a "solver"?

Diego:
I tried to explain.

16) "The most basic invocation is using only the name of the solver. "

Dan: Change "is using "to "uses"

Diego: done

17) Dan: The output from checkSolver looks bad:

Diego: I fixed it.

18) Dan: The documentation for chooseMons is incomplete.

Diego:
This was supposed to be hidden. So I deleted it.

19) "Given an SOSPoly with coefficients in the reals"
    
Dan: You are using the identifier SOSPoly as though it were an English word.  Stick
to words.  Check for other similar things.

Diego:
I fixed it in the places where I noticed it.

20) Dan: Change documentation node "coefficients field" to "coefficient field".

Diego: done

21) "Once the rational world has been left, there is usually now way back."

Dan: Change "now" to "no".

Diego: done

Dan: Leaving the rational world is ambiguous. The paragraph goes on to discuss "clean", but that doesn't get you back to the rational world.

Diego:
I rewrote the paragraph.

*****************
*  PDF Article  *
*****************

22) Dan: Peyrl is listed as an author of the package, but this authorship is not
acknowledged in the article.  Perhaps it should be. Or not?

Diego:
We discussed about this before, and we agreed to leave him out of the article. But we need to justify it.

23) Dan: Bibliography should include an item for Macaulay2 and for the SemidefiniteProgramming package

Diego:
Done. But I am not so sure how to cite SemidefiniteProgramming properly.

24) Dan: Fix hyphens

Diego:
I did my best.

25) "The SOS package allows to perform computations ..."
    "... and allows to select the SDP solver. "

Dan: Allows whom to perform computations?  Check all other uses of "allow".

Diego:
What is the problem with the word "allow"?

26) Dan: Change "In the above computation" to "In the computation above"

Diego: done

27) "Given a bound 2d ∈ N, "

Dan: The reader will wonder whether d ∈ N is required!

Diego: Fixed.

28) Dan: What's the definition of "real radical"?

Diego:
Needs to be done. I forgot it today.

29) "i1 : R = QQ[x,y,z][s,t]; -- s,t are treated as parameters"

Dan: Move comments about the code to the surrounding prose

Diego: done

30) Dan: Don't overuse acronyms such as SOS and SDP.  

Diego:
I spelled out most of them.

31) Dan: What is a solver?  

Diego: fixed
