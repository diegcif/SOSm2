My guess is that the referee was Dan, and he gave us lots of comments.  Many of the comments are about English grammar, so I am not completely sure that I addressed them correctly.

Below I enumerate all the comments.

********************
*  Macaulay2 code  *
********************

1) Dan: Articles in JSAG are always about a single package.

Diego:
It seems that the SemidefiniteProgramming package won't be
certified. I assume that the procedure here should be similar as in
NumericalAlgebraicGeometry and its many dependencies. Personally, I do
not mind if only the SOS package is certified.

Thomas: OK.

2) Dan: There are differences in the top level files, which reflect various housekeeping tasks performed on the Macaulay2 side.

     --11
    +-- fails every night under Ubuntu 16.04
    +-- TEST /// --lowerBound
     --13
    +-- keeps failing overnight under Ubuntu 16.04, host habanero
    +-- TEST /// --sosdecTernary

Diego:
The M2 repository omits two checks (above). Each of them has multiple
subtests (lowerBound has six and sosdecTernary has three). I would
like to know which of them are failing, and perhaps only drop those.

Thomas: I remeber discussing this issue with Dan last fall.  I don't
understand why these tests fail for him.  Ideally they should not
fail?  I think Mike Stillman built it under some sort of Linux and all
tests passed.

3) Dan: What about changing the name of the package to SumsOfSquares?

Diego:
I don't mind. What do you think, Thomas?

Thomas: Yes, let's change it.  I think I did the change, but please
check.

4) "Executing CSDP
    Input file: /var/folders/hq/7lqcg89j1pq8m9vq_333xfwh0000gn/T/M2-3434-0/53.dat-s
    Output file: /var/folders/hq/7lqcg89j1pq8m9vq_333xfwh0000gn/T/M2-3434-0/54
    Status: SDP solved, primal-dual feasible
    Start rational rounding"

Dan: The 5 lines of trace output are noise

Diego:
I changed the optional argument Verbose to Verbosity. Nothing is
printed when it is set to 0.

Thomas: I think this is not so good.  "Verbose" is a symbol that is
globally defined and used by many packages.  Maybe it is better to
stick to the Boolean Verbose and just omit the above lines if not
Verbose?  Currently the package is also broken because "Verbosity" is
not exported.

5) Dan: Don't use "return" so much

Diego:
I removed most of them.

*******************
*  documentation  *
*******************

6) Dan: Be careful with hyphens (e.g. sum-of-squares)

Diego:
I did my best to fix this.

Thomas: So the convention is now that sum-of-squares is hyphenated?

7) "The SemidefiniteProgramming package in Macaulay2 ships with the CSDP solver"

Dan: Reveal the name of the package as a link to it
    Replace "ships with" with "includes"

Diego: done

Dan: Spell out "CSDP" 

Diego:
I clarified that CSDP is a solver.

8) "Check Solver for how to configure different solvers."

Dan: Change "Check" to "See"
    Remove "different"

Diego: done

9) Dan: All sentences should end with punctuation. Don't end with colons.

Diego: done

10) "contains in particular the SOS decomposition"

Dan: Remove "in particular"

Diego: done

11) Dan: change "found decomposition" to "decomposition found", and check similar constructions

Diego:
I changed it, but I am not sure what he means by "similar constructions"

12) Dan: Spell out acronyms (SOS, SDP).

Diego:
I spelled out most of the occurrences.

13) Dan: The word "summands" is unclear.

Diego:
I fixed it. The word "summand" no longer appears.

14) "This method tests if various functions work properly using a specified solver. "

Dan: change "if" to "whether"

Diego: done

15) Dan: What is a "solver"?

Diego:
I explain in the documentation that it is tool.

16) "The most basic invocation is using only the name of the solver. "

Dan: Change "is using "to "uses"

Diego: done

17) Dan: The output from checkSolver looks bad:

Diego: fixed

18) Dan: The documentation for chooseMons is incomplete.

Diego:
This was supposed to be hidden. So I deleted it.

19) "Given an SOSPoly with coefficients in the reals"
    
Dan: You are using the identifier SOSPoly as though it were an English word.  Stick
to words.  Check for other similar things.

Diego:
I fixed it in the places where I noticed it.

20) Dan: Change documentation node "coefficients field" to "coefficient field".

Diego: done

21) "Once the rational world has been left, there is usually now way back."

Dan: Change "now" to "no".

Diego: done

Dan: Leaving the rational world is ambiguous. The paragraph goes on to discuss "clean", but that doesn't get you back to the rational world.

Diego:
I rewrote the paragraph.

=============================================================================

*****************
*  PDF Article  *
*****************

22) Dan: Peyrl is listed as an author of the package, but this authorship is not
acknowledged in the article.  Perhaps it should be. Or not?

Diego:
We discussed about this before, and we agreed to leave him out of the
article. But we need to justify it.

Thomas: Maybe just add a sentence to the PDF somewhere that
acknowledges that we started the package with a proof-of-concept
implementation by Parillo and Peyrl?

23) Dan: Bibliography should include an item for Macaulay2 and for the SemidefiniteProgramming package

Diego:
Done. But I am not so sure how to cite SemidefiniteProgramming
properly.

Here is a fun way to do this:

i1 : loadPackage "PackageCitations"

o1 = PackageCitations

o1 : Package

i2 : cite SemidefiniteProgramming
stdio:2:1:(3): error: no method found for applying iCite to:
     argument   :  SemidefiniteProgramming (of class Symbol)

i3 : cite "SemidefiniteProgramming"
--warning: symbol "Jacobian" in ReesAlgebra.Dictionary is shadowed by a symbol in NAGtypes.Dictionary

--warning: symbol "SemidefiniteProgramming" in PackageDictionary is shadowed by a symbol in User#"private dictionary"

o3 = @misc{SemidefiniteProgrammingSource,
       title = {{SemidefiniteProgramming: A \emph{Macaulay2} package. Version~0.2}},
       author = {Diego Cifuentes and Thomas Kahle and Pablo A. Parrilo and Helfried Peyrl},
       howpublished = {A \emph{Macaulay2} package available at \url{https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/tree/master/M2/Macaulay2/packages}}
     }


24) Dan: Fix hyphens

Diego:
I did my best.

25) "The SOS package allows to perform computations ..."
    "... and allows to select the SDP solver. "

Dan: Allows whom to perform computations?  Check all other uses of "allow".

Diego:
What is the problem with the word "allow"?

Thomas: I guess the noun and the verb don't fit.  How can a package or
method allow something.  The most direct meaning is "to give
permission" which is too colloquial for the technical language here.
I reformulated all "allows" except one (which I thought was OK).

26) Dan: Change "In the above computation" to "In the computation above"

Diego: done

27) "Given a bound 2d ∈ N, "

Dan: The reader will wonder whether d ∈ N is required!

Diego: Fixed.

28) Dan: What's the definition of "real radical"?

Diego:
It is explained now.

29) "i1 : R = QQ[x,y,z][s,t]; -- s,t are treated as parameters"

Dan: Move comments about the code to the surrounding prose

Diego: done

30) Dan: Don't overuse acronyms such as SOS and SDP.  

Diego:
I spelled out most of them.

31) Dan: What is a solver?  

Diego: fixed
