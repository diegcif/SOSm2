    Description
      Text
        Let $S^n$ be the space of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices,
        and let $L \subset S^n$ be a rational affine subspace.
        By @TO2 {smat2vec,"vectorization"}@ we may describe this subspace in the form  $A q = b$ for some matrix $A$ with $n(n+1)/2$ columns.
        Given a real matrix $Q\in S^n$, this method finds a nearby rational matrix $Q_p$ on $L$.

    Description
      Text
        The method {\tt smat2vec} obtains the vectorization of a symmetric matrix.
        The method {\tt vec2smat} performs the reverse operation.
      Example
        A = matrix(QQ, {{1,2,3,4},{2,5,6,7},{3,6,8,9},{4,7,9,10}})
        v = smat2vec A

        The scaling of the off-diagonal entries can be controlled with the optional parameter.

    Description
      Text
        Given a positive semidefinite matrix $A$, this method returns a lower triangular matrix $L$ with ones in the diagonal, a diagonal matrix $D$ and a permutation matrix $P$ such that $L D L' = P' A P.$
      Example
        A = matrix(QQ, {{5,3,5},{3,2,4},{5,4,10}})
        (L,D,P,err) = LDLdecomposition(A)

    Description
      Text
        This method solves a primal/dual pair of semidefinite programs.
        Given symmetric matrices $C, A_i$ and a vector $b$, the primal problem is

        $$min_{X} \, C \bullet X \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, A_i \bullet X = b_i \, and \, X \geq 0$$

        and the dual problem is

        $$max_{y,Q} \, \sum_i b_i y_i \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, Q = C - \sum_i y_i A_i \, and \, Q \geq 0$$

        The default algorithm is a dual interior point method implemented in M2. 
        A strictly feasible initial point $y_0$ may be provided by the user.
        Alternatively, there is an interface to the @TO2 {[solveSDP,Solver],"solvers"}@ CSDP, SDPA and MOSEK.
      Example
        C = matrix {{1,0},{0,2}};
        A = matrix {{0,1},{1,0}};
        b = matrix {{-1}};
        (X,y,Q) = solveSDP(C,A,b);

    Caveat
        $\bullet$ The "M2" solver does not return the primal solution.

        $\bullet$ The "M2" solver might fail if the dual problem is not strictly feasible.
