TODO:

1) Describe how "DefaultSolver" works?
  Default solver can be used to prever e.g. SDPA over CSDP.

2) Create bigger and more complicated tests for solveSOS 

3) Check doc of SOSdecTernary

4) Doc of checkSolver

5) Create Quickstart page / section


WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
-) realZeros should work on a nontrivial example
-) createSOSModel should be faster than solving the SDP

8) The following doesn't work with CSDP
    R = QQ[x,y];
    h = matrix{{y-x^2}};
    lowerBound (y, h, 2, Solver=>"CSDP");
