Manual to commit changes to this package to the main M2 repository:

1) There are example outputs with CSDP that need to be created and
committed.  They are to be found in the directory SOS/examples,
but are not currently part of our git.  A submission to M2 main repo
consists of

a) SOS.m2
b) SOS/SOSdoc.m2
c) SOS/examples/*.out for all files with CSDP output

2) Make sure DebuggingMode is not enabled.

3) Is the version number and date OK?

TODO:

7) solveSOS has no test in quotient rings and only one which is
parametric

8) Support for Mosek

WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
-) realZeros should work on a nontrivial example
-) createSOSModel should be faster than solving the SDP
