Manual to commit changes to this package to the main M2 repository:

1) There are example outputs with CSDP that need to be created and
committed.  They are to be found in the directory SOS/examples,
but are not currently part of our git.  A submission to M2 main repo
consists of

a) SOS.m2
b) SOS/SOSdoc.m2
c) SOS/examples/*.out for all files with CSDP output

TODO:

1) Describe how "DefaultSolver" works?
  Default solver can be used to prever e.g. SDPA over CSDP.

2) Create bigger and more complicated tests for solveSOS 

3) Check doc of SOSdecTernary

4) Doc of checkSolver

5) Create Quickstart page / section

6) Discuss "Mon and Q lie in different rings"

7) solveSOS has no test in quotient rings and only one which is
parametric

WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
-) realZeros should work on a nontrivial example
-) createSOSModel should be faster than solving the SDP

8) The following doesn't work with CSDP
    R = QQ[x,y];
    h = matrix{{y-x^2}};
    lowerBound (y, h, 2, Solver=>"CSDP");
