SOS.m2
======

A sum of squares package for Macaulay 2.

SOS.m2 is a [Macaulay2](http://macaulay2.com) package for computing
sum of squares (SOS) decompositions of multivariate polynomials with
rational coefficients. The algorithm uses an interior point method to
solve the underlying semidefinite program and attempts to compute an
exact rational decomposition from the numerical solution.
