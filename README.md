SOS.m2
======

A sum of squares package for Macaulay 2.

SOS.m2 is a Macaulay2 package for computing sum of squares (SOS)
decompositions of polynomials with rational coefficients. The
algorithm uses an interior point method to solve the underlying
semidefinite program and tries to compute an exact rational
decomposition from the numerical solution.
